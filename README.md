# Introduction to Selection 

Hello There!<br><br>
So for me, learning new things can be scary at times, it just seems like it's too much and I can't learn it all and.... <br>
<b>So ...</b> I felt like I needed something to make the process more fun and this was created! <br>
This repository is a collection of really simple and introductory codes in a bunch of languages, some of them might be <i>really</i> short but the whole idea was to just get started, I might not have added more than that here. <br>
That's about all I have to say, thank you for checking this out:)
