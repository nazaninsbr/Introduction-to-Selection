logining in
	
	login:	mininet
	password:	mininet

what to do and in what order?
	1. login 
	2. $ ifconfing 
	3. check out hte eth0 address 

		it was 10.0.2.15
	4. $ ssh -X mininet@10.0.2.15
	5. $ sudo mn

		see step 5 image to see that we now have these things:
			two hosts 
			1 switch 
			a controller 

		I have created an image of the topology named topology_1

		some of the commands we have here:

			help 
			nodes
			dump 
				more info on the components of the network 
			net 
				network links between devices 
			h1 ping h2
				you can use control+C out of there

				the fist ping took more time than the rest because for the first packet the switch has to inform the controller and wait for a reply on what to do with the packet so the extra latency is because of the communication with the controller after that what it needs to do is cached in the switch so we no longer have to go through asking the controller 
			xterm h1
				I got an error telling me that it could not "connet to display" but in the ideal world it would have opened another window with the prompt that belonged to h1

			h1 ping -c3 10.0.0.2 
				the 10.0.0.2 is h2
			h1 ifconfig 
				see the ip address belonging to h1 which for me was 10.0.0.1
			in the h1 shell
				tcpdump -n 
					-n 		no name resolution 

				you need to run h1 ping h2 in the main shell to be able to see the results in the h1 shell 
			pingall
			iperf 
				to get the bandwidth 
				for me it tested the TCP bandwidth between h1 and h2 and the result was 25.4 Gbits/sec
			iperfudp 
				the udp bandwidth 
			exit 
	6. $ sudo mn -c
		mn is mininet
		-c does a clean up for after when you close your mininet prompt, like cleaning up the zombie processes and stuff like that 
	7. $ sudo mn --link tc,bw=10,delay=10ms
		this is a way to introduce latency to all your links 
		bw=10
			bandwidth of 10 Mbits/sec
		you can see the result in an image called step 7

		now if we run iperf again we can see that we get a much lower result comparing to what we got last time 
			last time = 25.4 Gbits/sec
			this time = 9.49 Mbits/sec
